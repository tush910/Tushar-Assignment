Assignment 4

Observations:-
1. With the help of sudo su command we been to root folder 

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-30-17 ~]$ sudo su
[root@ip-172-31-30-17 ec2-user]# ls
istio-1.5.2  istio-1.5.2-linux.tar.gz  kubernetes-training


2. to clone the file from github we used this command " git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app"



It cloned everything into the current directory. On using ls command we can see the following files


3. With the help of "cd k8s-specifications" we entered into the directory and on using "ls" we could see the different YAML files in the directory.


4. On applying "kubectl apply -f ." It is creating pods for all the YAML files are available in the directory


5. We faced little errors due to name space and nodeports, to  resolve it we changed namespace to default and nodeports after which we opened browser and entered http://3.0.147.251:32004/

It opened the webpage for voting 

And simultaneouly I opened another tab to check the result page for that I entered http://3.0.147.251:31004/

It opened the webpage for result

6. I casted my vote and the result page was observed to be working correctly. I also tried to alternate my choices and it was observed that result webpage was changing accordingly.

7. On deleting the vote and result pods new pods are created and it did not effect the working of app.

8. On deleting the db-pod the result page was not working as previously. It is observed that on restarting the result pod, result started to work but  it lost some previous data.




Assignment 1:-

The DaemonSet feature is used to ensure that  pods are scheduled and running on every single available node. When a node is removed,
the DaemonSet controller ensures that the pod associated with that node is garbage collected.
Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up all the pods that DaemonSet has created while in case of replica set whenever you delete a node or pod,
it will create a new pod simultaneouly
This is the common use case


Assignment 2:-

1. Get the deploys using kubectl get deploy
2. go to vi "yaml file name" and make changes 
2. Then deploy the updated file using using "kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2"
